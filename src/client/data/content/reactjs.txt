Here are some of the benefits of using React.js.

React.js allows you to focus on the specific logic of your view and deeply customize that, while it takes care of rendering, updates and re-rendering when your model changes.

1) Cross-platform support

  React.js enables developers to create applications for multiple platforms such as Android and iOS simultaneously. This feature makes it a better option than native app development wherein the company needs to develop separate versions of the same application for different platforms.

2) Clean and responsive UI

  React makes it possible for you to build an interactive interface that is as effective and responsive as a native app. It allows you to focus on the user experience instead of worrying about adjusting to different screen sizes, devices, and platforms.

3) Component re-usability

  Components are the building blocks of a React app. They can be reused between different applications, and they can also be shared on NPM. Reusable components should have a single responsibility, and not handle business logic, app state, or DOM manipulation.

4) SEO-friendly

  React.js is SEO-friendly, helping your site rank higher on search engines and thus generate more traffic and sales conversions. Every page can be updated by re-rendering only a particular component to ensure that users don't see any broken or stale content as they navigate through your website.

5) Flawless performance

  React enables developers to build feature-rich UIs with no compromises on app performance. React.js apps are quick to load and can handle a vast amount of data manipulation. Your users will find your app incredibly smooth and engaging.

6) Supportive community

  React has one of the largest developer communities in today's environment. It is vibrant, and active with many members willing to help & advice from many different sources which makes it a great community as there is always a source or person for any area of assistance needed.
